# üéâ Implementation Summary: Voice-Based Dynamic IELTS Speaking Test

## ‚úÖ Completed Features

### 1. Dynamic AI-Generated Questions ‚ú®
**Status**: Fully Implemented and Tested

**What Was Built:**
- Created `DynamicIELTSQuestionGenerator` service that generates unique questions via Gemini API
- 12 different themes (Technology, Travel, Education, Health, etc.)
- 6 different examiner personalities (Friendly, Professional, Warm, etc.)
- Thematic coherence across all questions in a session
- Intelligent fallback to static questions if API fails

**How It Works:**
1. When user starts a test, a random theme and personality are selected
2. Gemini API generates Part 1 (personal), Part 2 (cue card), and Part 3 (abstract) questions
3. All questions connect to the chosen theme naturally
4. Each session is completely unique

**Example Output:**
```
Theme: "Technology and Innovation"
Personality: "friendly and encouraging"

Part 1:
- "Let's talk about technology. How often do you use technology in your daily life?"
- "What type of technology do you use most frequently?"
- "How has technology changed your daily routine?"

Part 2:
"Describe a piece of technology that has improved your life"
- What the technology is
- When you started using it
- How it has helped you
- Why it is important to you

Part 3:
- "How has technology changed the way people communicate in your country?"
- "What impact does technology have on employment in modern society?"
```

### 2. Voice-Based Question Delivery üéôÔ∏è
**Status**: Fully Implemented and Tested

**What Was Built:**
- Integrated TTS (Text-to-Speech) service throughout test interface
- Auto-narration of questions when displayed
- Natural spoken delivery for Part 2 cue cards with examiner instructions
- Replay button to hear questions again
- Visual indicators showing when examiner is speaking

**How It Works:**
1. Question appears on screen
2. TTS automatically speaks the question
3. "Speaking..." indicator shows during narration
4. User can click "Replay Question" anytime
5. When moving to next question, it's automatically narrated

**Part 2 Natural Speech Example:**
```
"Now I'm going to give you a topic and I'd like you to talk about it 
for one to two minutes. You have one minute to think about what you're 
going to say. You can make some notes if you wish.

[Reads cue card]
Describe a piece of technology that has improved your life
- What the technology is
- When you started using it
- How it has helped you
- Why it is important to you

Alright? Remember you have one to two minutes for this, so don't worry 
if I stop you. I'll tell you when the time is up."
```
